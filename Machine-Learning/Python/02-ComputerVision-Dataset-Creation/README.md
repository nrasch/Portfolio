# Summary

This set of write-ups covers creating a dataset of images suitable for use in future machine learning projects.  It is currently broken down into serveral Jupyter notebooks.  The Jupyter notebooks are listed below, and you can click the hyperlinks to load them:

* [Image Dataset Creation - Part One](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nrasch/Portfolio/blob/keras/Machine-Learning/Python/02-ComputerVision-Dataset-Creation/ImageDatasetCreation-PartOne.ipynb)
  
  * The objectives of this write-up include:
    * Find and acquire a suitable set of images
    * Process a small subset of images as a proof of concept for the image dataset creation process
    * Output a portable binary data container containing the subset of processed images

* [Image Dataset Creation - Part Two](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nrasch/Portfolio/blob/keras/Machine-Learning/Python/02-ComputerVision-Dataset-Creation/ImageDatasetCreation-PartTwo.ipynb)

	* Implementation of the prototype and ideas developed in [part one](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nrasch/Portfolio/blob/keras/Machine-Learning/Python/02-ComputerVision-Dataset-Creation/ImageDatasetCreation-PartOne.ipynb)
