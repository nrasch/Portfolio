Despite featuring big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole. It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls'.<br /><br />Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named 'Dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he's rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick.<br /><br />Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.\"  \n",

To be straight with you, this film doesn't contain much of a riveting story, nore does it make u 'want' to know how it'll end...but I'll tell you something now...never have I been as tense and jumped up before in my life! This film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills! To be fair, I did watch it at almost midnight so I was kinda sleepy anyway, so maybe that explains why I was jumpy...or maybe it's because this film does deliver in that aspect! It's basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. They decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains...all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (i think it's it's the sister of the main character, and she brings along her husband)...during the night, the husband hears noises...checks it out, and thats when things start to go really really wrong...they don't stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isn't right...to cut a long story short...eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of.<br /><br />It's not a Hollywood blockbuster, nore does it have a huge budget, but please don't let that put you off. It's creepy, tense and very very jumpy! Just give it a try :)\"                                                                                                                                                                    "

They\\'re about zombies killing people, preferably in the most gruesome way possible. That\\'s what makes them SCARY.<br /><br />- White people who can pay $1600 to get to a rave deserve to die.<br /><br />- If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. Anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks, \\\\\"What was that?\\\\\" or, \\\\\"Where are we?\\\\\"<br /><br />- Bare breasts are not horror movie panacea.<br /><br />- A helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with Sega magically transforms your movie from \\\\\"student film\\\\\" to \\\\\"major studio release\\\\\". Try it!<br /><br />- Just because you can name-drop all three \\\\\"Living Dead\\\\\" movies, that does not make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson.<br /><br />I\\'ve seen worse movies, but only because I\\'ve seen \\\\\"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation.\\\\\"\"'"

    "\n",
    "In short the BOW doesn't care about grammar or word order.  It does; however, care about how many of each word appear in the target corpus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> In practice, the Bag-of-words model is mainly used as a tool of feature generation. After transforming the text into a \"bag of words\", we can calculate various measures to characterize the text. The most common type of characteristics, or features calculated from the Bag-of-words model is term frequency, namely, the number of times a term appears in the text. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model)\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the sample review '9170_1' we were examining above we notice that the word 'bad' appears twice, and the words 'worse' and 'awful' appear once.  It is highly likely that other reviews with a negative rating will also contain these words along with others such as 'hate', 'waste', etc.  In these cases the BOW decide that these reviews are similar and place them in the same 'bag' as review '9170_1' (i.e. a negative review classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wikipedia article provides another example:\n",
    ">In Bayesian spam filtering, an e-mail message is modeled as an unordered collection of words selected from one of two probability distributions: one representing spam and one representing legitimate e-mail (\"ham\"). Imagine that there are two literal bags full of words. One bag is filled with words found in spam messages, and the other bag is filled with words found in legitimate e-mail. While any given word is likely to be found somewhere in both bags, the \"spam\" bag will contain spam-related words such as \"stock\", \"Viagra\", and \"buy\" much more frequently, while the \"ham\" bag will contain more words related to the user's friends or workplace.\n",
    "\n",
    ">To classify an e-mail message, the Bayesian spam filter assumes that the message is a pile of words that has been poured out randomly from one of the two bags, and uses Bayesian probability to determine which bag it is more likely to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn has a [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) module we can utilize to create the 'bags of words' numeric representation of the reviews suitable for the machine learning model."

    "The cell above took a little over 15 hours to complete, and we gained around 1% in accuracy.  Was it worth it?  Probably not, because I'm assuming models we'll develop and assess later on will have better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we did gain; however, is a solid example of why a quick and dirty model is a valuable thing to create early on in the process.  It gives you a baseline you can measure further efforts and gains against.  So in this case we know that the baseline model which took a fraction of the time is almost just as good as a time consuming model we had to run overnight.  Clearly there isn't a good ratio of efforts-to-results here, and so we either need to 1) settle on the baseline LR model to meet our needs, or 2) explore some other avenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose option two then we can continue to compare against the baseline model to guide our efforts and hopefully avoid wasting lots of time with suboptimal solutions."
